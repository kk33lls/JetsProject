# JetsProject

## Description
The Jets project is an object-orientend Java program that provides the user an interactive  dispaly of an airfield. Within this airfield the user has nine different options for interaction, such as listing the aircrafts, adding aircrafts, removing aircrafts. and extracting the data on aircrafts to view details such as their range. 

## Technologies Used
 - Java
 - Eclipse
 - Git/Github
 - Sublime Text Editor
 - zsh

  ## Concepts Applied
 - Input/Output streams, reading text from file
 - Try and catch exceptions
 - Downcasting
 - Interface implementation
 - Object oriented programming  (Abstraction, Polymorpheism, Inheritance, and Encapsulation)
 - Switch
 - For loops

 ## Lessons Learned
 This project intially seemed a bit daunting, but once getting it started it wasn't all too difficult. My understanding of creating isntances of objects and using them in seperate classes has become much more solidifed. Downcasting to call a method from an interface was probably where I struggled the most and will plan to study a bit more. I also learned how creating additonal empty scanner calls can help prevent previously stored information from dictating a new scanner call when it is necesary to get new input from the user.
